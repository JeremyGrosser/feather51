**This project is a work in progress**

FEATHER51 is an [Adafruit Feather](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather/feather-specification) compatible main-board using the Silicon Labs EFM8UB1 microcontroller. It is designed to be an easy entry point for learning assembly language on real hardware using an open source toolchain. This project is Open Source Hardware! See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.

# Project status

Revision A was released to manufacturing on 2019-04-15. While we wait for that, firmware, documentation, and tooling development continues.
